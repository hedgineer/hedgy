# Hedgy

Hedgy is an AI framework designed to give investors access to the best technology and AI systems to make better risk adjusted returns. Building on powerful LLMs we integrate 
best in class processes and APIs into a single AI framework so that your AI knows how to use the technology and data for you.

## Examples of things you might ask Hedgy:
- What are the biggest risk factors in my portfolio?
- Can you help me understand why EV/EBIDTA is diverging between GM and FORD?
- What alternative data do you have on Johnson Controls supply chain dependencies in South America? How accurate does it explain their inventory backups?
- Have there been any corporate access events that I missed over last 6 months that were important?
- Let me know if there are any S1 filings relevant to my coverage space.


## How It Works?
Hedgy uses standardized API documentation to create prompts that instruct the AI how to route user requests to the corect API AND how to call the API directly. The hedgy code base acts as an orchestration layer between the User -> AI -> API. This enables the AI to use factual data when generating results and allows the AI to leverage the intenal tools in ways that a human may not be able to or not have the time.

We rely on human curation of the correct APIs to use and the best way to use technology in a research process and allow the AI to bridge the gap between a user and what tools need to be used. These APIs are initially located in the `/src/hedgy/api/` directory with additional meta data stored in the `__init__.py` file.
